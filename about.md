Welcome to my minimal presence on Github Pages.

I'm a data scientist based in Sydney, Australia. Currently (2021) I work for the NSW Department of Education.

Github is where I keep my "hobby projects", coded mostly in R. My repositories [are here](https://github.com/neilfws?tab=repositories).

Long ago in a former life, I wrote a PhD thesis in the field of molecular microbiology. I recently digitised it and [made it available here](https://neilfws.github.io/thesis2021/index.html).
